          <h2>Mountains: Kapaʻa, Hawaii</h2>
          <p>
            From the beginning, this place was different from the other local
            communities. It was a haven. Because of its marshy landscape, it was
            not controlled by plantation owners like so many other towns
            throughout Hawaiʻi. Here, field laborers, ordinary families, and
            plantation luna (overseers) lived together as equals. No matter how
            poor someone was or where they came from, they were welcome in this
            place.

          <h2>Milky Way: Uruguay</h2>
          <p>
            The Milky Way is the galaxy that includes our Solar System, with the
            name describing the galaxy's appearance from Earth: a hazy band of
            light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be
            individually distinguished by the naked eye.

          <h2>Feeling Blue: Mont-Saint-Michel, France</h2>
          <p>
            Mont-Saint-Michel is a tidal island and mainland commune in
            Normandy, France. The island lies approximately one kilometre off
            the country's north-western coast, at the mouth of the Couesnon

          <h2>Aerial Shot: Egypt Desert</h2>
          <p>
            Egypt, a country linking northeast Africa with the Middle East,
            dates to the time of the pharaohs. Millennia-old monuments sit along
            the fertile Nile River Valley, including Giza's colossal Pyramids
            and Great Sphinx as well as Luxor's hieroglyph-lined Karnak Temple
            and Valley of the Kings tombs. The capital, Cairo, is home to
            Ottoman landmarks like Muhammad Ali Mosque and the Egyptian Museum,
            a trove of antiquities.

          <h2>Zebras: Tanzania</h2>
          <p>
            Tanzania is an East African country known for its vast wilderness
            areas. They include the plains of Serengeti National Park, a safari
            mecca populated by the “big five” game (elephant, lion, leopard,
            buffalo, rhino), and Kilimanjaro National Park, home to Africa’s
            highest mountain. Offshore lie the tropical islands of Zanzibar,
            with Arabic influences, and Mafia, with a marine park home to whale
            sharks and coral reefs.

          <h2>Northern Lights: Northwest Territories</h2>
          <p>
            They occur when charged particles from the sun interact with the
            Earth's atmosphere and create a light show in the sky. The different
            colors of the aurora are caused by different gases in the
            atmosphere, and the unique shape of the aurora is caused by the
            Earth's magnetic field.

          <h2>Elephants: Condado De Nakuru, Kenia</h2>
          <p>
            Kenya is a country in East Africa with coastline on the Indian
            Ocean. It encompasses savannah, lakelands, the dramatic Great Rift
            Valley and mountain highlands. It's also home to wildlife like
            lions, elephants and rhinos. From Nairobi, the capital, safaris
            visit the Maasai Mara Reserve, known for its annual wildebeest
            migrations, and Amboseli National Park, offering views of Tanzania's
            5,895m Mt. Kilimanjaro.

          <h2>Wavy: Baler, Aurora.</h2>
          <p>
            Today, surfing is becoming a popular weekend activity; both for
            travelers coming from Manila, or foreign travelers looking for the
            best stoke. They go to Baler to either surf, learn to surf, or just
            surf all over again not only at Charlie’s Point, the most popular
            surf spot in Baler, but also at Cemento, among others. Hostels, hip
            cafes, and artisan restaurants now line up the long shoreline of
            Baler, creating a communal vibe where travelers, artists, and locals
            bond over their shared love for surfing.

          <h2>Mt. Fuji: Japan</h2>
          <p>
            Japan’s Mt. Fuji is an active volcano about 100 kilometers southwest
            of Tokyo. Commonly called “Fuji-san,” it’s the country’s tallest
            peak, at 3,776 meters. A pilgrimage site for centuries, it’s
            considered one of Japan’s 3 sacred mountains, and summit hikes
            remain a popular activity. Its iconic profile is the subject of
            numerous works of art, notably Edo Period prints by Hokusai and
            Hiroshige.

          <h2>Humans: Unknown</h2>
          <p>
            Human intelligence is a mental quality that consists of the
            abilities to learn from experience, adapt to new situations,
            understand and handle abstract concepts, and use knowledge to
            manipulate one's environment.

          <h2>Architecture: Santorini, Greece</h2>
          <p>
            Santorini is one of the Cyclades islands in the Aegean Sea. It was
            devastated by a volcanic eruption in the 16th century BC, forever
            shaping its rugged landscape. The whitewashed, cubiform houses of
            its 2 principal towns, Fira and Oia, cling to cliffs above an
            underwater caldera (crater). They overlook the sea, small islands to
            the west and beaches made up of black, red and white lava pebbles.

          <h2>Volcano Eruption: Guatemala</h2>
          <p>
            Volcanoes erupt when molten rock called magma rises to the surface.
            Magma is formed when the earth's mantle melts. Melting may happen
            where tectonic plates are pulling apart or where one plate is pushed
            down under another. Magma is lighter than rock so rises towards the
            Earth's surface.
